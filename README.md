# NFT_MINT
This last project will bring together everything you've learned with a little Web3 spice for flavor!

For your project, you will simulate minting NFTs by writing some JavaScript code. The code will create an object that represents an NFT and that will hold its metadata. The metadata can be anything you want, such as car name, car color, engine type, and price. Once you have the object, you will need a variable to store all of your NFTs in. Next, you will need a function to print the details of your NFTs to the console.




Assessment Requirements
1. Create a variable that can hold a number of NFT's. What type of variable might this be?
2. Create an object inside your mintNFT function that will hold the metadata for your NFTs. 
   The metadata values will be passed to the function as parameters. When the NFT is ready, 
   you will store it in the variable you created in step 1
3. Your listNFTs() function will print all of your NFTs metadata to the console (i.e. console.log("Name: " + someNFT.name))
4. For good measure, getTotalSupply() should return the number of NFT's you have created
